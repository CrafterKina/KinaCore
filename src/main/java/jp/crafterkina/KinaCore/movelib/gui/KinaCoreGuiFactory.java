     screen, the same as all Minecraft GUIs. The expected behaviour is that this screen will replace the "mod list"
     screen completely, and will return to the mod list screen through the parent link, once the appropriate action is
     taken from the config screen.
     <p/>
     A null from this method indicates that the mod does not provide a "config" button GUI screen, and the config button
     will be hidden/disabled.
     <p/>
     This config GUI is anticipated to provide configuration to the mod in a friendly visual way. It should not be abused
     to set internals such as IDs (they're gonna keep disappearing anyway), but rather, interesting behaviours. This
     config GUI is never run when a server game is running, and should be used to configure desired behaviours that
     affect server state. Costs, mod game modes, stuff like that can be changed here.

     Return a list of the "runtime" categories this mod wishes to populate with GUI elements.

     Runtime categories are created on demand and organized in a 'lite' tree format. The parent represents the parent
     node in the tree. There is one special parent 'Help' that will always list first, and is generally meant to provide
     Help type content for mods. The remaining parents will sort alphabetically, though this may change if there is a lot
     of alphabetic abuse. "AAA" is probably never a valid category parent.
     <p/>
     Runtime configuration itself falls into two flavours: in-game help, which is generally non interactive except for
     the text it wishes to show, and client-only affecting behaviours. This would include things like toggling minimaps,
     or cheat modes or anything NOT affecting the behaviour of the server. Please don't abuse this to change the state of
     the server in any way, this is intended to behave identically when the server is local or remote.
